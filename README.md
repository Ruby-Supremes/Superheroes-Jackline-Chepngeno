. Have at least three resources (three DB tables).

# Description
It is a code challenge that was about working on an API for tracking heroes and their superpowers.

# Project Setup
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:
. Create a new Rails project.
. Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PART OF RUBY-SUPREMES ORGANIZATION).
. Ensure you regularly commit to the repository.

## Models
You need to create the following relationships:
- A `Hero` has many `Power`s through `HeroPower`
- A `Power` has many `Hero`s through `HeroPower`
- A `HeroPower` belongs to a `Hero` and belongs to a `Power`

Add any code needed in the model files to establish the relationships.
Then, run the migrations
You are welcome to generate your own seed data to test the application.

## Validations
Add validations to the `HeroPower` model:

- `strength` must be one of the following values: 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Average'

Add validations to the `Power` model:

- `description` must be present and at least 20 characters long
